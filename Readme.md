<h1 align="center">React app setup without using create-react-app</h1>


## Overview

React is a Javascript library, and since it is a library and not a framework, we can use it in our Javascript project just as we'd use any other library. Only that we need necessary configurations to bundle our files and output a file we can inject in our main HTML(public/index.html)

- Note: public/main.js is generated when you run "npm run build"
